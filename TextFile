So family we have two folders

client and server

client - will hold our front end
server - will be our Express server

Lets create the component now!!

Remember that these will be in different routes/pages
So we need to create routes...

Now we have all the components and styling done, 
I now have to make them responsive and then get to the backend/ dashboard component.
